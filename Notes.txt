Angular application Architecture

Module: a collection of multiple related components
        eg: An order module can consist of 2 components 
            a) A shipping address component
            b) payments component


Components: a component is the smallest independent unit of an Angular app that serves one purpose inside the
            app


MVC Architecture:


Every component in angular has 4 files

1) <component-name>.component.ts: logic for component's functionality
2) <component-name>.component.html: view part of the component goes here!
3) <component-name>.component.css: styling for the component goes here. COMPONENT SPECIFIC
4) <component-name>.component.spec.ts: write unit tests for the component here.


2-way binding:

It is a scenario in which an activity in the view file is linked to component.ts and vice-versa.


one-way binding and two-way binding

One-way binding:
1) Data-Binding
2) Event-Binding
3) Style-binding
4) Class-Binding

angular supports 2 types of forms
1) template driven
2) reactive forms

simple forms with very few fields : Template driven forms
complex forms : Reactive forms (model driven form)


how to make a template driven form
1) decide the layout of the form and create properties in component class for each field
2) in the html: create a form tag: 2 compulsory attributes must be there: FORM MUST BE MAPPED TO A HTML TEMPLATE 
VARIABLE
3) each filed in the form has to be stored in its own div tag -> div tag: class="form-group"
4) each html component of the form gets one class name of form-control
